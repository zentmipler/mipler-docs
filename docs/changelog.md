## 🗓️ Jan 2023

After months of dedicated effort, we are proud to announce the launch of a new version of our platform. 👌

This release features a comprehensive overhaul of the business calculation definition syntax, making it more robust and user-friendly.

The update is powered by **ACE** (Advanced Calculation Engine), a powerful tool that enables users to perform calculations on their data using a syntax that is similar to Excel.

With ACE, you can manipulate your data with greater ease and precision, making it a valuable addition to any data analysis workflow.

After several months of hard work, we finally released a new platform version with a fully updated business calculation definition syntax.
